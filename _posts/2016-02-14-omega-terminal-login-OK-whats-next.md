If you are not used to work with the terminal, you might be happy to get some additional information what you can do within this "**Black-Box**".

To get more info about what commands you can use just type:

     busybox --help

and you will get a overview of what busy-box is and all commands available over it.

     busybox --list

if you prefer a list of all this commands.

If you need more explanation about a certain command just use:

     busybox ifconfig --help

(ifconfig is the equivalent of **ipconfig** in Windows)


Several times I also read people asking which openWRT is running.

The release/version files can be made visible with:

      cat /etc/*_release

or

      cat /etc/*_version


Further information about the base of Omega OS you find by openWRT
