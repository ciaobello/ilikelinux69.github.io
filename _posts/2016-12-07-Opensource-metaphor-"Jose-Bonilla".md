Metaphor supermarket vs. restaurant

>Supermarket vs. restaurant meals can be much like open source vs. closed source. When you order food from a restaurant, you typically are provided with everything you need to enjoy your meal, including the service. But when your meal isn’t to your liking, you are prohibited from entering the kitchen and changing things for yourself. Whereas with supermarket shopping, you are free to create the type of meal you want. You can create the meal to your liking by following a recipe and the recipe can be thought of as the source code for the meal. While more effort and skill are needed, the outcome is more enjoyable and less expensive.”
